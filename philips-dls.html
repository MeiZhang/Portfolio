             <h2>The design principle </h2>
             <p> The principle of Philips design language system (DLS) is simple, accessible, conversational and clear. Being clear is the core because many products are used in medical contexts where doctors have a limited amount of time to conduct tasks. At the same time, the system should be accessible to everybody. </p>

             <h2>Design for functions, a better way to build products</h2>
             <p> The DLS system is made for all platforms (web, iOS, Android and PC). It provides a consistent experience to users. Designers and developers can communicate efficiently with the same guidelines. And it gives both groups more time to focus on real work.</p>

             <h2>A growing ecosystem </h2>
             <p> The DLS is never ending and keep growing as an ecosystem. JSON is used to manage color and size updates and also guard the overall design. The design team is using an in-house Sketch plugin to reflect real-time database values on the design files.</p>

             <h2>Lessons learned</h2>
             <p> <b>Components  as symbols in Sketch:</b>Working with components as symbols in the sketch was not handy, especially for designers in vertical projects. The problem often occurred in resizing components. So far in the DLS Sketch library, components are not created as symbols and it is easier to use. </p>

             <p> <b>A single source of truth:</b> In the beginning, there was much confusion because of findings and decisions were all over the place. After introducing JSON and Git, the design team started working more efficiently. We were benefited by the combination of Git and Sketch, and we asked other teams to use the same tools. </p>

             <p><b>Gathering use cases:</b>Many use cases were not considered when creating new components. And a lot of feedback was received after publishing. Conducting full context research is necessary before creating components, and it helps to harmonize the user experience not only in visual level. </p>

             <p><b>Working with developers:</b>Developers have a better view of how much effort it takes to build a component. It is necessary to check with them very often and book more time for important components. Also, their knowledge of native platforms behavior is very valuable and joining their grooming sessions is a must for designers.</p>
