             <p class="my-role">The DEV team was migrating the lot detail pages to make it possible to run A/B test on these pages. It was a great opportunity to redesign the mobile lot detail page as it needs a lot of UX improvement. </li>
             <h2 style="margin-top: 56px;">Success metrics</h2>
             <p>The unique bidders and total revenue are increased with the new design.</p>

             <h2>Competitive analysis and research </h2>
             <p> The design team analyzed other practices such as Etsy, eBay, Taobao, bol.com, Booking, and Airbnb and summarized the good things we can borrow. Besides, we looked into all the A/B experiments history and gathered insights about what triggered visitors to bid.  For example, clear shipment info and the ability to chat with sellers are very important for converting visitors to bidders. </p>

             <p> All designers provide a redesign mockup based on the 
             research above. And we discussed and combined good parts together into a "final" mockup. </p>

              <h2>Improve the image view </h2>
              <p>From a past A/B experiment where mobile grid view won against list view with bigger images,  we learned that bigger images delight users. Therefore, for the redesign, we made the image view as big as possible, also increased the thumbnail image size. As we have many elderly users, a "tap to enlarge" tag is added to explain the usage. </p>

              <h2>Better information hierarchy</h2>
              <p>According to user studies, bidders care the seller reviews and also the shipping information the most. They would like to buy from trustworthy sellers who do not have a bad history such as selling fake items. Furthermore, the bidding status and bidding history are also very important as it helps users to decide when and how much to bid.  The new design focused on improving the information hierarchy as the current design does not put the most needed info under the spotlight. </p>

              <h2>Mobile friendly bidding block</h2>
              <p>The bidding block used to be on the same page and users scroll down to the bidding block when tapping on the bid button.  To make this call to action mobile friendly, the new design triggers a new pop page instead,  and it provides more space to display shipment information and estimated delivery date. </p>

              <h2>The next step</h2>
              <p>Measuring if the number of unique bidders increases after launching the new design.  Because we believe that the new page is easier for visitors to find lot information and therefore converts visitors to bidders. </p>
              <p style="margin-top:24px;">Many corner cases will be considered such as auto bids, two bids placed at the same time, a bid placed at the last minute etc. The design principle here is to be transparent and explanatory so that first-time bidders will not get confused. </p>

              <img src="image/lot-detail-7.jpg">
              <p style="margin-top:48px;">Regards the design, we will continue study which layout patterns is better for the users. There are two ideas, one is using the expanders and the other is using top tab views. </p>

             <h2>Lessons learned</h2>
             <p><b>Be bold:</b> Migrating the lot detail pages is a 5-month work and it was a bold decision to do it. As this page is the only place for users to bid, many hypotheses can be tested after migration and that is the key to our product development.</p>

             <p><b>Gather the design team:</b> As the lot detail page was a big work, all designers from the team made a mockup out of their best. And we hold a meeting to combine the good parts together into one version.  This was a nice way of generating creativity and learn from other team members. </p>
