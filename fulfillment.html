                        <p>Working on my own, my role is to discover the UX problems in the fulfillment (post-purchase) pillar at Catawiki.com. And provide big impact bets for future product growth.</p>

                        <h4>APPROACH</h4>
                        <p>Making the customer journey maps to give me a holistic view of the product UX based on data, and then define big problems. It also educated me great knowledge about the product and what can be improved.</p>

                        <h4>SUCCESS METRICS:</h4>
                        <p>Reduction in customer support tickets and increase on average seller review scores.</p>

                        <h2>Creating the customer journey maps</h2>
                        <p>Gathering data and analyzing the overall UX were the two main purposes. The maps covered all platforms (web and apps) with data from users research and CS ticket analysis. They were built step by step from user expectations -- company values -- the reality to help me define the gaps and the came up with bets.</p>

                        <h2>Define the problems</h2>
                        <p>After visiting the overall user flows, quantitive data from CS and user research, here are the problems found:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>-Sellers ship lots later than 3 days</li>
                            <li>-Seller put wrong track and trace code for shipping</li>
                            <li>-Shipping time is too long</li>
                            <li>-Buyers do not pay in time</li>
                            <li>-Lots are damaged or not as described</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Why these problems became problems, and how can I solve them? I started a deep dive with the two questions below.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><i>1. What are the root causes of the problems in the UX/product level? </i></li>
                            <li><i>2. Is there any improvement in the UX level that can prevent or solve the problems?</i></li>
                        </ul>

                    <h3>
                        Manage the expectation of buyers
                    </h3>
                    <p>Although the promise is that all lots will be delivered within 14 days, 25% of over-continent shipping takes more than 14 days. It is hard to change the fact that the shipping duration is longer than average e-commerce platforms, but being transparent to buyers about the estimated time of delivery can reduce frustrations after purchase</p>
                    <p><br /> Quick solution: Inform buyers about the estimated time of delivery in my orders page.</p>
                    <p><br /> Validation: An A/B experiment was run but the result was not significant. It also did not have any negative effect and from the experience design point of view, this new feature was kept.</p>

                        The UI is not reflecting what's going on
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        I did a touchpoint map that mapped out when and how Catawiki communicate to buyers and sellers. A shocking finding is that all the important information was communicated via emails, and there are no notifications integrated into the product.

                    </p>
                    <p><br />Quick solution: Make changes on the UI level when some actions are required. For example, when a track and trace code is not correct, mark it in red in the seller center to warn sellers.</p>
                    <p><br /> Validation: After the new feature, the valid track and trace code percentage increased by 5%. he future qualitative study will be carried about what is the best way to remind sellers.</p>

                        Sellers and buyers do not communicate
                    </h3>
                    <p>Many problems could be resolved between sellers and buyers without contacting CS. However, the product does not encourage buyer and seller communication.</p>
                    <p>
                        <br />Quick solution: Before problems occur, guide buyers and sellers to talk to each other. For example, if a seller does not ship in time, ask the buyer to contact the seller to ask why. And also guide the seller to inform the buyer a reason for the delay. In this way, buyers' doubt are removed and CS effort is saved.
                    </p>
                    <p><br />Next step: Build up the default pre-fill text and translation in the chat system and build entry points for the chat when buyers and sellers needs communicate. Validate the design concepts</p>

                    <p>
                        Many sellers are not pro sellers and they need some guide to impress buyers. Integrate the seller guide during the selling flow can teach sellers what to do in each step. It is easier for sellers to do the right thing on the right spot and improve the experience of both buyers and sellers.

                    </p>
                    <p><br />Quick solutions: Give sellers guide about how to pack lots when lots are sold. Show sellers a timer to guide them ship on time. Guide sellers to talk to buyers when a shipping takes longer. Guide sellers to gift repeat buyers to gain better reviews...</p>
                    <p><br />Next step: Refine the design and gather feedback from long tail sellers. Launch the design and monitor if the number of CS tickets reduces.</p>

                        <p><em>A holistic view of UX:</em> Before this exercise, I used to focus on a small part of the product. It was necessary to walk through the entire user journey and gain a holistic view. It helped me understand why a problem occurs by identifying holes in the UX strategy level of the product.<br><br /></p>
                        <p><em>Prioritize with the DEV team:</em>Although there were many valuable findings from the maps, I forget to reach to the DEV team regarding how to execute the ideas at an early time. Next time it worth a prioritization exercises together so that DEV effort and limitation can be taken care.<br><br /></p>                    </div>
