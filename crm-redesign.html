                        <h4>MY ROLE</h4>
                        <p>Working on my own, understanding the needs of CS agents at Catawiki, coming up with a redesign proposal and validate it.</p>
                        <h4>PROBLEM DEFINITION</h4>
                        <p>Customer support agents use the customer info page to solve CS tickets. However, it is hard to use because: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>- Information is all over the place and a lot of brain power is required to remember routes to find necessary information.</li>

                            <li>- The visual design is not clean and clear. Information is crowded.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>SUCCESS METRICS</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                - Qualitative: CS agents feel easier and less stressed to solve CS tickets.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                - Quantitative: The average time for solving a CS ticket is reduced
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Understand the pain points</h2>
                        <p>To have a deep understanding of the problem before getting to a solution, I interviewed 3 CS agents and found an answer to the question "why it is hard to use". Bringing commonly searched information out of the deep ground is the key to solve some pain.</p>

                        <h2>Co-create with CS agents</h2>
                        <p>I organized a card sorting workshop with CS agents to create a new information architecture. They are the experts here to sort out info that is looked up frequently. And they also taught me what info needs to be found together for solving a type of CS ticket. </p>

                        <h2>Information architecture</h2>
                        <p>I made the final information architecture map based on the conclusion from the workshop. With the new design, agents can go to an order info site very easily. And important info such like customer login access stays right after 1 click. </p>

                        <h2>Clean, clear and space to breath</h2>
                        <p>Solving CS tickets is a stressful and fast-paced task, I addressed 3 keywords for the visual design: clean, clear and space to breath. As information can be overloaded to the CS agents, more space between information and clear visual hierarchies will make their life easier.</p>

                        <h2>Prototype and qualitative validation</h2>
                        <p>In order to test the design before implementation, a high-fidelity prototype is made to gather user feedback. As expected, although there were some small change requests, CS agents were very positive about the new design and scored 9/10 in confidence that the new design will increase their working efficiency.</p>

                        <h2>The next step</h2>
                        <p>After the implementation, an pilot test will be conducted to test if the new design reduces the average time spent in solving a CS ticket. Moreover, Hotjar will be used to track if there is a page that agents bounce very quickly. If so, I need to find out what they are missing on that page.</p>

                        <h2>Lessons learned</h2>
                        <p><em>Work close with users:</em>Interview with the agents and the workshop really helped me put myself into users' shoes and understand the problems. It made the design process fast and also gave me confidence in designing.<br><br /></p>
                        <p>
                            <em>Just start somewhere:</em>This project sounds big at the beginning and I wanted to solve everything in one goal. But thinking in this way does not help. Instead, start somewhere and solve the most painful problems first. And later on, address other problems gradually.
